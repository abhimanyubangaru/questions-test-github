      In this website, you will be able to answer different questions about the different dorms. <br/>
      The navigation bar will remain at the top of the screen at all times. Once inside the game section, please click on
      the different buttons(each has a distinct dorm name) to be taken to different question sets.
    <br/><strong> When you are on the last question, the next button will disappear. </strong><br/>
      Don't worry, just click on one of the other sets.

        <br/>

      Have fun!
